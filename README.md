# CALIFORNIA ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS PROGRAM MAPPING (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)
This repository is an online map showcasing the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFD) in California.

## DEMO VERSION: https://wooserkpark.github.io/California_EIFD

## DATA

Come from the California local governments' reports.

## NOTE

To enhance the potential of the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Development (EIFD) program, thankfully, Mark Polhemus, a former Place-Based Business and Economic Development Specialist at the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, shared information on the EIFD program. 

The recent data, updated through 2023, is available in the 04_document folder, and I share the location mapping images (a manual process) in the 03_image folder.
