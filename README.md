# Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts Program Mapping in California (Work-in-Progress)
This repository is an online map showcasing the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFD) in California.

## Demo Version: https://wooserkpark.github.io/California_EIFD

## Data
The California local governments' reports. To enhance the potential of the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Development (EIFD) program, thankfully, Mark Polhemus, a former Place-Based Business and Economic Development Specialist at the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, shared information on the EIFD program. 

## NOTE
The recent data, updated through 2023, is available in the 04_document folder, and I share the location mapping images (a manual process) in the 03_image folder.

### Example: Aggie Square EIFD
