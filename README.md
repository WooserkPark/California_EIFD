# Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts Program Mapping in California (Work-in-Progress)
This repository is an online map of the Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFD) in California.

## Demo Version: https://wooserkpark.github.io/California_EIFD

## Data
California local government reports. To enhance the potential of the EIFD program, Mark Polhemus, a former Place-Based Business and Economic Development Specialist at the California Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, kindly provided information on this program.

## NOTE
The recent data, updated through 2023, is available in the 04_document folder, and I share the location mapping images (a manual process) in the 03_image folder.
